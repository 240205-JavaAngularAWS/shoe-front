    <!-- If we want to bind an event to these pieces I'll create the function on component's TS file and bind it using () -->
    <!-- I want to make it so that when we click on the text for the todo it will mark it completed and will cross off the text -->

    <!-- We want to update the todo text to be crossed out if the todo is marked as completed -->
    <!-- I'll use the attribute directive ngClass to control what css class is affecting the element based off some condition -->
